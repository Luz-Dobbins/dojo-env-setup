    "When working with big data, we often work with data that has a lot of columns -- or a lot of dimensions. Machine learning is a great tool to use with high dimensional data because it can pick up on patterns in high dimensional spaces that would be impossible for humans to pick up on. However, challenges can arise when working with high dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"curse of dimensionality\" refers to a phenomenon that arises when working in increasingly higher dimensional spaces - as the number of features increases, the amount of data needed to accurately generalize a model to new data grows exponentially.\n",

For example, if you are building a model to predict the price of homes, you can choose to use only the top most important features in your final model and leave out the features that may not be important to the model.\n",

    "Principal Component Analysis, abbreviated as PCA, is one of the most common techniques used for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "It is an unsupervised learning technique, meaning we do not use a target/y-vector for this technique! PCA is applied to our features and is used to reduce the dimensions of our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA transforms our features into a new set of variables called Principal Components, which are linear combinations of all of our original features. The algorithm relies heavily on linear algebra topics and understanding the math behind it is beyond the scope of this course, but if you are interested in learning more about how the algorithm works behind the scenes, check out the optional sections at the end of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Principal Components (PCs) are arranged in order of how much variability they explain: the first PC explains the most variance of our original data, while the last PC explains the least amount of variation of our original data. We choose a select number of PCs that cumulatively explain enough variance in our data yet still reduces the dimensionality of our feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is useful for two main tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization: if we have high-dimensional data that would be impossible to visualize, sometimes by transforming that data into a lower-dimensional space we can visualize things like clusters.\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction to improve model speed: we can use PCA to first reduce the dimensions of our data, then use the PCs for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing PCA, we assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are linear relationships between our features.\n",
    "Importance is determined from variance, i.e. higher variance means it is more important.\n",
